üê∂ Dog Gallery Website

This project is a responsive dog image gallery built with HTML5 and CSS3. It displays a collection of dog photos with captions arranged in a neat grid layout. The design is minimal and beginner-friendly, making it a great project to practice front-end development concepts such as CSS Grid, Flexbox, and image styling.

The gallery layout is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a smooth viewing experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. Each image card includes a caption, giving the gallery a clean and organized look. This project can be easily extended by adding more images, hover effects, or even connecting to APIs for dynamic content
